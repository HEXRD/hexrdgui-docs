# Introduction

Welcome to the HEXRDGUI documentation!

![HEXRDGUI Summary Image](img/hexrdgui_summary_image.png)

HEXRDGUI is a cross-platform open source application for analyzing and
visualizing X-ray diffraction image data. Build upon the Highly Extensible
X-Ray Diffraction ([HEXRD](https://github.com/hexrd/hexrd)) Python library along with several scientific
Python libraries, HEXRDGUI provides many interactive workflows for
visualizing and processing diffraction images using the generic
multi-detector instrument model in HEXRD.
